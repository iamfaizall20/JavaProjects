Sure! Here's a clean and **shorter version** of the Java Projects `README.md`:

---

# 🚀 Java Projects

A collection of my Java projects to practice and demonstrate core concepts, including:

- ✅ Control Structures & Loops  
- 🧠 OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)  
- 📊 Data Structures & Algorithms  
- 📁 File Handling  
- 🛠️ Mini Console Apps (like Task Manager)

## 🔧 How to Run

1. Clone the repo  
2. Open any project folder in your IDE  
3. Run the `.java` file with the `main` method

## 📁 Example Structure

```
/java-projects
├── ArrayOperations/
├── FileHandling/
├── MiniApps/
└── README.md
```

## 💡 Purpose

Built for learning, practicing DSA, and creating reusable Java components.  
Let’s grow one project at a time! 💪

Let me know if you want a one-liner for each folder too!
